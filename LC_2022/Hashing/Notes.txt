Hash map strategies:

Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together.

For example, given strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"], return [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]].

- sort the strings and store as keys in a hash map.
- append each unsorted string to its corresponding sorted key.
- return the hashmap.values()


Given an integer array cards, find the length of the shortest subarray that contains at least one duplicate. If the array has no duplicates, return -1.

- essentially we need to find the shortest distance between two elements of the same identity.
- create a hashmap to track the index (location) of each item.
- the item will be the hashmap key and the indexes form the values.
- this can be improved to O(n) space complexity for the worst case if we only store the previous
index for each key (rather than storing a list of indexes for each key).
